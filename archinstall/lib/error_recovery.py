"""
Interactive recovery from errors that would otherwise abort the installation.

Rather than exiting on the first failed command, the installer halts and asks the
user how to proceed. Every prompt is built the same way: the caller supplies the
choices that are meaningful for its own failure, and this module appends the two
escape hatches that always apply -- resolve the problem by hand in a shell, or
stop the installation.

The prompt is deliberately plain ``print``/``input`` and must only be used
outside of the Textual application, i.e. during the installation itself.
